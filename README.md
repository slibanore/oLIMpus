# oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross-Power Spectra in the Epoch of Reionization

---

**oLIMpus** is an actively maintained and expanding Python-based framework for simulating line intensity mapping signals during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). It provides a fast and efficient way to compute **non-linear power spectra** of star-forming lines, and generates both **coeval boxes** and **lightcones**.

The 21cm signal is introduced by interfacing oLIMpus with [`Zeus21`](https://github.com/JulianBMunoz/Zeus21), a public code for 21cm signal modeling at cosmic dawn. A version of `Zeus21` is included in this repository as a submodule. Note that the original `Zeus21` currently models only the power spectrum during cosmic dawn; support for the reionization era is under active development.
