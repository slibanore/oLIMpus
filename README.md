# oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross- Power Spectra in Cosmic Dawn and Reionization

---

`oLIMpus` is an actively maintained and expanding Python-based framework for simulating line intensity mapping (LIM) signals during the epoch of reionization (EoR). It provides a fast and efficient way to compute **non-linear power spectra** of star-forming lines, and generates both **coeval boxes** and **lightcones**.

The 21-cm signal is introduced by interfacing oLIMpus with [`Zeus21`](https://github.com/JulianBMunoz/Zeus21), a public code for 21-cm signal modeling at cosmic dawn. A version of `Zeus21` is included in this repository as a submodule. Note that the original `Zeus21` currently models only the power spectrum during cosmic dawn; support for the reionization era is under active development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

We recommend creating a new virtual environment based on **python 3.10** when installing the code, to avoid dependency conflicts.
If you don't have [`CLASS`](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/) installed in your laptop, first run these lines (modifying the Makefile to your `gcc` as needed):
```
git clone https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public.git class
cd class/
make
cd python/
python setup.py install --user
```

To install `oLIMpus`, if you have **conda** in your laptop you can simply run the **setup.sh** file through
```bash
  chmod 755 setup_env.sh 
  ./setup_env.sh
```
This will create the conda environment **oLIMpus**, install the code and all dependencies, and install jupyter to run the notebooks. 

Otherwise, you can run the installation in the folder where you downloaded the repository, through:
```bash
pip install .
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

> oLIMpus includes its own version of Zeus21 as a submodule, last updated in June 2025; later versions of Zeus21 may introduce changes that are not compatible with this code. If, for some reason, you want to run oLIMpus with a different Zeus21 version, contact us to verify differences between various versions.

> The authors are committed to keep the two codes updated and compatible once new milestones are reached on one side or the other.

## üîß Included Modules

- **`inputs_LIM.py`**  
  Set the input parameters to compute the line luminosity and to set the properties of the power spectrum (e.g., linear/quadratic lognormal, with/without shot noise, with/without RSD).

- **`LIM_luminosities.py`**  
  Default models for the line luminoisty-SFR or -halo mass relations. Default includes models for OIII, OII, Ha, Hb, CII, CO21.

- **`LIM_modeling.py`**  
  Compute the quantities needed to setup the model (e.g., the line luminosity density and the coefficients of the lognormal).

- **`correlations_LIM.py`**  
  Computes auto- and cross-power spectra of various emission lines, including astrophysical nonlinearities, redshift-space distortions, shot noise.

- **`analysis.py`**  
  Fiducial setup, create a collective class to run oLIMpus and Zeus21 and get consistent outputs.

- **`maps_LIM.py`**  
  Functions required to produce coeval maps and lightcones.

- **`zeus21_local/zeus21/`** (submodule)  
  Modified version of [`Zeus21`](https://github.com/zeus21/zeus21) used to compute 21-cm power spectra and fields during cosmic dawn (reionization modeling in progress). For details, see Zeus21 official documentation.
